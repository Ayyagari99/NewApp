# Complete Bluetooth Communication App with Authentication

This is the complete Android Studio project.  
The user can sign up with name, email id, and a password. 
The email field cannot be empty. The password must be at least six characters long. 
All the credentials are sent to firebase accountand to login the credentials must be matched by firebase.
Aloding icon is added so that it does not seem like the app freezed, while the credentials are matched.
Link to login in the register page and link to register in login page.
The logout button will take the user to login page.
 
On start up, the app requests permission to switch on bluetooth.
One device lists all the once-paired devices. And connects to a particular device from the list. 
The other device listens for incoming connection request and then both the devices get connected.
Tapping on the number sends the number directly. A custom text message can also be sent by typing in the EditText and then tapping the send custom message button.
